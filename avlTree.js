//Implement an AVL tree (aka self-balancing binary tree). In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of
// any node differ by at most one
//; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.
// Lookup, insertion, and deletion
// all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the
// tree prior to the operation.
